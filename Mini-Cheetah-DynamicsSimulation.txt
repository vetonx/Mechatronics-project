*** Simulation of a quadruped mini cheetah dynamics through Matlab, Maple and MapleSim ***
Study and design of the dynamics of a Mini Ceetah leg, to be included in a final 4-leg simulation
of the dynamics. The study includes:
- application of a static load to the single leg model
- trajectory construction of walking activity
- trajectory following via inverse kinematic approach, working space definition
- landing movement of single leg model
- jumping control movement
- backflip simulation of the overall 4-leg model generated
- application of the model on a MapleSim environment for the complete simulation
of the backflip movement.
